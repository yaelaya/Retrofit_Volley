# Performance Evaluation of Kotlin and Java with Retrofit and Volley

This project evaluates the performance of Kotlin and Java, combined with Retrofit and Volley, for handling web service operations. The study compares key metrics such as response time, memory usage, CPU consumption, and binary size across various data sizes and types (JSON and XML). It also examines the efficiency of different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## 🛠️ Technologies

### 📱 Mobile Features
- Built with **Kotlin** and **Java**.
- Libraries: **Retrofit** and **Volley**.
- Includes features such as:
  - Handling JSON and XML data. 📄
  - Efficient HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). 🌐
  - Performance testing with different data sizes. 📊

### 💻 Web Technologies
- **Spring Boot** for backend services.
- **JPA Repositories** for database interactions.
- **MySQL** for data storage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install **Git**.
- Install **Java Development Kit (JDK)**.
- Install **MySQL** and configure it to use port 3306.

### 📱 Mobile Setup
1. Clone the Project:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_folder> ```

Run the project using your preferred IDE (e.g., Android Studio).

Install Backend Dependencies:
```
mvn clean install
```

Start the MySQL server and run the Spring Boot application.

Verify the backend is running at the same port.
